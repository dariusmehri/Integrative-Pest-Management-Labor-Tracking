### Integrative Pest Management Labor Tracking
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a sustainable approach to managing pests that focuses on long-term prevention and minimizing the impact of pests on the environment, human health, and property. The purpose of IPM pest treatments is to achieve effective pest control while minimizing the use of chemical pesticides and their potential negative effects. The goal of this project is to maximize NYCHA resident health and safety by tracking exterminators to uncover potential deceptive practices. 

#### Work Not Completed
IPM exterminations that take less than 30 minutes is considered insufficient time to complete the extermination process propertly. This visualization shows the count of jobs by exterminators and the proportion of those jobs conducted in less than 30 minutes:

#### Exterminators Stealing Time
IPM exterminations of over 120 minutes indicates the possiblity of stealing time. This visualization shows the count of jobs by exterminators that are greater than 120 minutes. The rotated bar chart on the left shows the total count of exterminations greater than 120 minutes, the table on the right compares the count of jobs less than and greater than 120 minutes:

#### Time Series
Time series analysis shows the count of exterminations and locations visited by the exterminator. A maximum of 6 exterminations and 10 locations is considered normal, above those counts is considered unlikely:

#### Pest Hot Spots
A heat map shows the developments and buildings where pests are prevalent, and where IPM is most needed:

#### Spatial Analysis
A map of NYCHA buildings shows where different types of pests are located. This map shows where mice are located in apartments:
